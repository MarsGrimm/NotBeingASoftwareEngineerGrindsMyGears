        <p>
            I am currently a supervisor in the Ford Credit customer service department. I have a huge passion for
            helping others achieve their goals and love all things analytical. Throughout my career and in every company
            Iâ€™ve worked for, I have frequently pursued and attained leadership positions. Along with being a leader
            throughout my career I have also consistently sought out ways to make processes more efficient. To
            accomplish this, I often turn to automating process via computer programing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to be a software engineer because I love puzzles and anything analytical. I studied computers in
            college and attained my undergrad in Management of Information Systems because it combined my passions for
            business and IT. I also love the process of solving complex situations or taking cumbersome processes and
            automating them with a computer.
